### Credits

I followed a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/9lqhMLFHj3A?list=PLMgDVIa0Pg8WrI9WmZR09xAbfXyfkqKWy) to make this. I added some more custom stuff(sounds and graphics) and worked on it a bit more beyond the tutorial for fun. 

All sounds were custom made by [Randy Blazer](mailto:xahydra@hotmail.com).

All graphics were custom made by me.
